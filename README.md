# Unparen Mode

`unparen-mode` toggles the display of parens. While they are hidden
away, the buffer is read-only, because currently this code does now
really add and remove parens -- it just makes them invisible. That
would be a nice feature, though. At the moment, this minor mode is
mainly useful to show lisp code to non-lisp coders affraid of parens.
